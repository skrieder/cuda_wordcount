Here is a list of things we need to do.

- Transfer an array of words to the device.
- Allocate and initialize the hashtable on the host, and transfer that to the GPU
- Transfer the master_hashtable back to the host.
- Iterate through the master_hashtable.

- Make the insert function parallel. (low priority, fairly easy)
