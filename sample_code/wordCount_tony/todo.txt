Here is a list of things we need to do.

1. Transfer an array of words to the device.
2. Transfer the h_master_hashtable to the GPU (Scott current)
3. Transfer the master_hashtable back to the host.
4. Iterate through the master_hashtable. (Iman?)
int iterate(Hashtable table){
    forall items in table
    	   print(key, value);
    return 0;
}

5a. Test that the locks work in put_nc
5b. Test that the locks work in get_nc

6. Make the insert function parallel. (low priority, fairly easy)

7. Parallel tokenize on GPU (Tony)

8. Give the students a simple example of put and get.
